            Cardiology is the study and treatment of disorders of the heart and the blood vessels. A person with heart disease or cardiovascular disease may be referred to a cardiologist.

            Cardiology is a branch of internal medicine. A cardiologist is not the same as a cardiac surgeon. A cardiac surgeon opens the chest and performs heart surgery.
            
            A cardiologist specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases of the cardiovascular system. The cardiologist will carry out tests, and they may perform some procedures, such as heart catheterizations, angioplasty, or inserting a pacemaker.
            
            Heart disease relates specifically to the heart, while cardiovascular disease affects the heart, the blood vessels, or both.
            
            To become a cardiologist in the United States, it is necessary to complete 4 years of medical school, 3 years of training in internal medicine, and at least 3 years specializing in cardiology.
            If a person has symptoms of a heart condition, their physician may refer them to a cardiologist.</p>

            
            <h4> That can indicate a heart problem include:</h4>
            <ul>
           <li> Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Dizziness</li>
            <li>Chest pains</li>
            <li>Changes in heart rate or rhythm</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
           </ul>
            
        
            A cardiologist can carry out tests for a heart murmur or an abnormal heart rhythm.
            
            They often treat patients who have had a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problems. They help make decisions about heart surgery, heart catheterization, and angioplasty and stenting.<BR>
            
           <h4 >Heart diseases that a cardiologist can help with include:</h4>
            
           <ul>

            <li>Atherosclerosis</li>
            <li>Atrial fibrillation</li>
            <li>Arrhythmias</li>
            <li>Congenital heart disease</li>
            <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
            <li>Congestive heart disease</li>
            <li>High blood cholesterol and triglycerides</li>
            <li>Hypertension</li>
            <li>Pericarditis</li>
            <li>Ventricular tachycardia</li>
            <li>High blood pressure, or hypertension</li>

            </ul>
            The cardiologist can give advice about preventing heart disease.
            
            A person may need to see a cardiologist even without symptoms, if they have a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol, if they are or have been a smoker, if they have diabetes, or if they are starting a new exercise program.
            
            A woman who has had pre-eclampsia may be at higher risk of heart problems in a later pregnancy or during the menopause.</p>
