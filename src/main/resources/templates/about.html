                <h3>Live Update</h3>
                <p>The idea is to help people from different fields, places and backgrounds to have a platform
                    where they can easily get the live update of patient admitted in the hospital without much
                    trouble since the web application will be made as simple and efficient as possible.Instead of looking around for treatment, you can easily get appointment, details and qualifications of doctors, medical test, reports and medicines
                    and live update of patient.
                    </p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Improved Experience</h3>
                <p>Checking out is instant-you don't waste time standing in queues. Don't forget, you
                    save time that would otherwise be wasted in travelling to and do admission process.
                    It's now common to see someone book online appointments for treatment, medicines and
                    payment. But given the state of traffic in big cities and the lack of time, online patient
                    live update seems to be the next big thing.
                    Like any online hospital management system, patient live update system also have a
                    larger variety of options available compared to what you find at your local hospitals.</p>

                <h3>Easy To Use</h3>
                <p>The goal of the project is to create a web application that will reduce the amount of time
                    and stress spent for waiting to get the health information by providing them live update of
                    their patient health in every one hour.
                    This application fixes the limitation and problems of paper based processes. The main goal
                    is to provide comfort and easiness by making the new technology of web pages design
                    easier and to search all possible live details of patient.</p>
